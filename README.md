# An-Empirical-Analysis-Using-Multivariate-Regression-and-Classification-Models

This study investigates the environmental determinants of health risk using a comprehensive
dataset of 5,811 observations that integrates air quality indicators, meteorological conditions, and
health outcome measures. The dataset includes key pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, O3, AQI),
weather variables (temperature, humidity, wind speed), and health metrics (respiratory cases,
cardiovascular cases, hospital admissions), along with two target variables: a continuous Health
Impact Score and an ordered Health Impact Class (Very Low to Very High). Its structured,
multivariate nature makes it well-suited for econometric analysis, predictive modelling, and public
health risk assessment.

Two research questions guide the empirical analysis. The first evaluates how pollutant
concentrations and meteorological factors explain variation in the Health Impact Score using a
Multiple Linear Regression framework (EHI-Model). The second examines how effectively the
same predictors classify observations into discrete health risk categories using a Multinomial
Logistic Regression model (HRC-Model). Hypothesis testing is conducted through
coefficient-level t-tests and Wald tests, along with F-tests and likelihood ratio tests for overall
model validity.

The regression analysis identifies PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and O3 as the strongest and most
statistically significant drivers of health impact severity. The classification model corroborates
these findings by showing that increases in these pollutants substantially raise the odds of
belonging to higher-risk health classes. Meteorological variables exhibit comparatively weaker
and inconsistent effects. Diagnostic checks confirm acceptable model stability, with robust
standard errors addressing normality and heteroskedasticity concerns.
Overall, the results offer strong and convergent evidence that fine particulate matter and reactive
gaseous pollutants are the primary environmental determinants of acute health burden. The
study provides actionable insights for regulatory policy, healthcare preparedness, and
environmental risk forecasting. Despite limitations—such as the synthetic nature of the data and
the cross-sectional design—the analysis demonstrates the predictive value of pollution indicators
in assessing population health risks and informs future research directions in environmental
health economics.
